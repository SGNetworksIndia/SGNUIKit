# The SGNUIKit

**_SGNUIKit_** is a very powerful UI kit designed to allow web developers use the power of the kit to build efficient and beautiful websites.
**_SGNUIKit_** is currently being used in all the websites by SGNetworks.
**_SGNUIKit_** is released under its exclusive license [SGN CS License v1.0](https://github.com/SGNetworksIndia/SGNUIkit/blob/master/LICENSE).

## REQUIREMENTS

* **Current SGNUIKit Version**: 1.1.4

### Core Requirements

| Technology | Version | Link                                                                        |
|------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| jQuery     | 3.6.0   | [https://jquery.com/download/](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js) |

_Note: If the dependencies omitted, it will neither break the features nor impact the performance of
as it comes built-in with **SGNUIKit** and the built-in dependencies will be used._

### Web Standards Compatibility (Web 2.0)

| Technology | Version (Minimum) | Version (Maximum) | Notes                                         |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|

| JavaScript | ES4               | ES6               | Some functions might break in minimum version |

## INSTALLATION

Download the latest version of **_SGNUIKit_** from:
[sgnuikit.lib.sgnetworks.eu.org/downloads](https://sgnuikit.lib.sgnetworks.eu.org/downloads/) or
[github.com/SGNetworksIndia/SGNUIKit/releases](https://github.com/SGNetworksIndia/SGNUIKit/releases), and extract the archive on the on any directory you want (preferably, `/assets/vendor/`).

Now add the following line of code `<script src="/assets/vendor/SGNUIKit/js/SGNUIKit.loader.js"></script>` between the `<head></head>` tags. And the rest will be taken care of by the *loader*.

Now you are ready to start developing your website using **_SGNUIKit_**. For more information, read the [documentation](#documentation).

We suggest you to set up **_AppCache_** and a **_Service Worker_** to enable caching. Doing so will make the web pages to load faster and your website will be able to load even in offline and
there are many other good reasons to set up **_AppCache_** and a **_Service Worker_**, one of them is it enables you to use **_Push Notification_** service.
We recommend you to do this as the main script is larger than **1MB** (approximately, **3.6MB**).
